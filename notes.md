# NOAA data

Exponents of the return distribution for different regions

Take different coast location at the beginning of available time and at the end.

+ Use temperatures in Kelvin
+ Center and normalize returns -> Power law exponent
+ Rigorously check if spectrum has the same allure across the years
+ Eigenvalues analysis without bootstrapping: 1000 choose 100 each time
+ Daily global temperature skewness and kurtosis
+ Calculate yearly average global temperature (one histogram per year)
  + Mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis
+ Can we obtain MP from bitcoin data?
